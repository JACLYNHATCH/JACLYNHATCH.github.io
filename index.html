                <h2>Tell us about yourself, Jaclyn.</h2>

                <h5>Interview conducted 2/28/2016</h5>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Tell us about your job as an industrial sewer.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: I was previously responsible for the stitching on Shinola's leather watch bands at their factory in Detroit. Besides producing
                    enough straps to fulfill the daily quota, I spent a lot of time reworking/resewing/saving otherwise rejected
                    pieces. Part of my creative responsibility was figuring out ways to be more efficient while maintaining
                    a high quality standard, including working with 1-2mm tolerances, needle and thread limitations, and
                    varieties in leather. I also operated up to 2
                    <span class="emphasis"><a href="http://grexviss.wix.com/linea20#!str-12/c84p">automatic sewing machines</a></span> at a time.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: What made you want to learn how to sew?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: I taught myself how to mend my own clothes by hand, so machine sewing was a natural and desired progression. When I found
                    out about an
                    <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://mtec.hfcc.edu/classes-training/industrial-sewing-certificate-program">industrial sewing program</a></span> through a facebook post, I had the reaction to enroll right away. Now
                    that sewing is my trade, pattern making and machine repair are next on my list.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: What has been your favorite thing to sew?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: So far I enjoy working with heavy duty materials.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: For people interested in a career as a production sewer, what would be the three most important things you would tell
                    them?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: 1) Master top &amp; bottom thread tension 2) Experiment with different materials, thread weights, and needle sizes—this
                    helped inform my problem solving process 3) Use the metric system for measurements—it's easier and more
                    precise
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Do you do any at-home sewing now that you are a skilled sewer?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: Mostly clothing repair.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: What does your sewing space look like at work? Do you have your own desk or storage spots? Or are you just mainly at your
                    machine all day?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: I try to keep my space as organized as possible so I can find my tools right when I need them. Most sewing machines have
                    their own storage compartment under the table. Regarding mobility at my previous employer, there was
                    a lot of back and forth between quality control at the end of the line and the stations before and after
                    my sewing area. We collaborated on issues we were having with different straps and shared a lot of tips,
                    tricks, and techniques with each other.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Describe your style.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: I maintain a minimal wardrobe. A goal of mine is to be able to make my own clothes so I can eventually teach others how
                    to do it themselves, too.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Vinyl or leather?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: Both!
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Q: Straight stitch or Zigzag stitch?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: I work primarily with a straight stitch, but I dig the variables of a zigzag. ◼︎
